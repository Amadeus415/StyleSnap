Okay, I understand. You're building a facial analysis app aimed at young adults on TikTok who want to improve their appearance. You need a refined prompt that provides a more generous score (averaging 60-80), ignores image quality when determining the score, and presents the output in a bullet-point format. Here's an optimized prompt, along with some suggestions:

  Instructions:

  1. **Scoring:**
      *   `score`:  A number between 0 and 100 representing the person's current facial attractiveness. Aim for an average score between 60-80 for most users. **Do not factor image quality into this score.** Focus solely on facial features.
      *   `potential_score`: A number between 0 and 100 representing the person's potential facial attractiveness if they were to make improvements based on your feedback.
      *   `confidence`: A number between 0 and 100 indicating your confidence level in the analysis.
      *   `skin`, `jawline`, `hair`, `style`, `smile`: Sub-scores (0-100) for specific facial attributes.
      *   `visual_age`:  An estimated age based on the person's appearance.
      *   `gender.perceived_gender`:  State whether the person in the image appears "Male" or "Female".
      *   `gender.masculinity_femininity`: A score from 0-100 indicating the perceived masculinity or femininity of the facial features (e.g., a very masculine face might score 90, a very feminine face might score 10, and an androgynous face might score 50).
      *   `age_percentile`:  An estimate of how this person's visual age compares to others (e.g., "Top 25% youngest looking").

  2. **Descriptions (Use Bullet Points):**
      *   `description.overall`:  Provide a bullet-point list describing the person's overall appearance. Focus on positive and constructive observations.
      *   `description.age_estimation`: A concise statement about the estimated age range.
      *   `standout`: A bullet-point list highlighting the person's most attractive or striking facial features. Be specific and encouraging.
      *   `not_standout`: A bullet-point list suggesting areas where the person could potentially improve their appearance. Phrase these suggestions positively and focus on actionable advice.
      *   `image_quality.overall_assessment`: A brief statementFor  about the technical quality of the image (e.g., "Good quality image," "Slightly blurry," "Poor lighting").
      *   `image_quality.lighting`: Bullet-point feedback on the image's lighting (e.g., "Well-lit," "Shadows obscuring features," "Backlit").
      *   `image_quality.focus`: Bullet-point feedback on the image's focus (e.g., "Sharp focus," "Slightly out of focus").
      *   `image_quality.composition`: Bullet-point feedback on the image's composition (e.g., "Centered," "Off-center," "Good use of the rule of thirds").
      *   `image_quality.resolution`: Bullet-point feedback on the image's resolution (e.g., "High resolution," "Low resolution, pixelated").

  3. **Tone:** Maintain a positive, encouraging, and constructive tone throughout the analysis. Remember your target audience is young adults seeking self-improvement.

  4. **Output Format:** Output must be in valid JSON format. Do not include any text before or after the JSON object.
